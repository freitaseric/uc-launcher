**Ultimate Craft** is a Minecraft modpack created by _Eric Freitas_ to provide a personalized survival gameplay experience.

Over time, the need to play with friends developed; however, each one used a different launcher for Minecraft, different operating systems, and we couldn't afford to buy a server to play.

It was then that the idea of creating a wrapper for the Minecraft client and server came to my mind, in such a way that it would be possible to open the program and enter the game with all mods and configurations correctly installed, as well as to start a local Minecraft server as desired and make it available to the internet via Ngrok.

This way, I made it possible for me, my friends, and anyone using this program to play together without needing to spend on Minecraft hosting or deal with complications related to installing and configuring mods.
